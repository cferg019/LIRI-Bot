<h2>Overview:</h2>

The LIRI-bot app has been developed as a one stop shop for searching for all sorts of entertainment options and information. 

This app allows the user to search for music on Spotify, movie details on OMDB, and even find events hosted by their favorite artists. 

<h2>Instructions: </h2>

In order to use LIRI-bot, you will need to start in your terminal. 

Find the folder where our friend, LIRI, lives. 

Once you are in that folder, start with 'node liri.js' 

From here, you can choose your command from a few options:
* **spotify-this-song** --> This command will allow you to input a song (or song & artist) to search Spotify for information on that song and to receive a link to a clip of the song. 
* **concert-this** --> This command will allow you to input an artist and find out where their upcoming shows are. If they are not touring, the app will prompt you to try searching for a new artist.
* **movie-this** --> This command will allow you to input a movie title and find out information about the movie requested such as plot, ratings, key actors, and more.
* **do-what-it-says** --> This command will provide a surprise search based on what the developers have built in. In this case, the user will be treated with a Spotify search of the Backstreet Boys' hit, I Want It That Way.

After your command, you can input your search request based on which command you have chosen. <br> If you have chosen 'do-what-it-says' no search request will be necessary.<br>
Don't forget to include your request in quotes to ensure accuracy!

Hit enter, and enjoy the results!
